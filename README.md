<b style="font-size:1.5em;"><i>Description</i></b>\
This is a personal project. This is a D.A.O.(Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Here you can be a part of an organization where the proof 
of your identity in the organization is by owning a soulbound token or a SBT which is a modified NFT.
If an individual has an SBT in his/her wallet then he/she is a part of the organization. 
In this organization you can create proposals which are financial and non financial.

Financial proposals are created by entering the title, description, recipient address, concerned department, amount and deadline. 
Then voting commences during the activation period.
The activation period is 2 days before the deadline. Once the deadline is met the proposal is finalized and depending on the voted the funds go from the 
treasury of the organization or the proposal is declined. The proposer can also finalize the proposal.

Non financial proposal are meant for trivial matters in an organization and no funds or recipient address are involved here, just regular voting.

This organization also has departments and depending on the department that the proposal is concerned with and depending on the voters department the
voting power of the voter changes. If the voters department and the concerned department of the proposal are the same then voters power is 1.2 times a regular vote.

<b style="font-size:1.5em;"><i>Motivation</i></b>\
One motivation behind this project was to create an organization on a blockchain because of the nature of blockchain and the security it provides, another 
was to create a voting system where people who have more knowledge about a subject matter will have slightly higher (about 20% in this instance)
voting power than those who don't, thus the organization has departments. 
In this instance of D.A.O. the organization is a college therefore the departments here are college branches.
